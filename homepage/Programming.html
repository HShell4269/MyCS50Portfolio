                <br>Programming to me right now has been very intriguing and fun to create and problem solve,
                <br>but first, let us go back to my early years when I was first exposed to this specific topic.
                <br>When I was young around 8-11 years old I never really understood what computer science
                <br>oor programming is. I first saw it on my cousin's laptop as he was coding a simple recreation
                <br>of solitaire without the fancy visual graphics, just purely seeing it as code.

                <br>5-6 Years late I would find myself getting interested in how programs, apps, and even games
                <br>function to create what we see on our computers and phones today. I found myself deeper into
                <br>finding out how each program works and what kind of code they run on. Often discovering
                <br>the most common programming languages like C++, Python, and JavaScript. Until I actually started
                <br>to code a little bit here and there, but I find myself lost as to where I should really start in
                <br>this journey that I took. Then my parents helped me discover CS50.

                <br>I had some speed bumps along the way but I pushed on until I made it this far. Currently creating
                <br>this and the final project to which I will be passing soon after and get that CS50 Certificate!
